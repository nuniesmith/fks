# 游댮 FKS Project Issues: Prioritized by Severity

*Last updated: October 22, 2025*

## Executive Summary

The FKS project is approximately **90% complete** with a solid foundation, but progress is held back by critical artifacts, stub implementations, and failing tests. As a solo developer, focus should be on **blocker resolution** to unlock the remaining 10% and achieve full functionality.

## 游댮 HIGH SEVERITY ISSUES

### Security (Critical - Immediate Action Required)
- **游댮 .env Placeholder Secrets**: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'CHANGE_THIS_SECURE_PASSWORD_123!'`, `PGADMIN_PASSWORD: 'CHANGE_THIS_ADMIN_PASSWORD_456!'`, `REDIS_PASSWORD: empty` - Direct breach risk in production
- **游댮 Exposed Database Ports**: PostgreSQL (5432) and Redis (6379) exposed without authentication in docker-compose.yml
- **游댮 Incomplete Security Configuration**: Security libraries not properly configured, API keys potentially exposed
- **游댮 Unauthenticated Commands**: `start.sh` allows unauthenticated access to sensitive operations

### Code Quality & Completeness (Blocks Development)
- **游댮 25+ Empty/Small Files**: Dead code accumulation detected by analyze script, causing confusion and maintenance overhead
- **游댮 Import Issues & Failing Tests**: 20/34 tests failing due to legacy microservices imports (`config`, `shared_python`) per copilot-instructions.md
- **游댮 Stub Implementations**: Core functionality in tasks/RAG/backtesting remains as stubs, preventing feature completion
- **游댮 Code Duplications**: Multiple versions like `engine.py`/`legacy_engine.py`, `generator.py`/`legacy_generator.py` causing confusion
- **游댮 Under-Counted Tests**: Analyze script only detects 4 tests vs. actual 34+ test files, indicating detection gaps
- **游댮 Logging-Heavy Imports**: Excessive logging imports impacting performance and code clarity

### Testing & CI/CD (Prevents Validation)
- **游댮 20/34 Failing Tests**: Core functionality cannot be validated, blocking deployment confidence
- **游댮 No Full CI Pipeline**: Beyond stub implementations, no comprehensive continuous integration
- **游댮 Low Coverage Goals**: Current coverage below acceptable thresholds for production readiness

## 游리 MEDIUM SEVERITY ISSUES

### Configuration & Dependencies (Impacts Reliability)
- **游리 Massive requirements.txt**: 59 packages with potential conflicts and security vulnerabilities
- **游리 Empty .env Fields**: Critical configuration fields left blank, causing runtime failures
- **游리 Truncated Docker Logs**: Log truncation prevents proper debugging and monitoring
- **游리 Host-Specific Ollama Cache**: GPU/CPU configurations tied to specific hardware, breaking portability
- **游리 GPU Assumptions in start.sh**: Script assumes GPU availability without graceful fallback

### Documentation & Knowledge Gaps (Impacts Maintenance)
- **游리 Outdated README.md**: Documentation doesn't reflect current architecture and setup procedures
- **游리 Truncated ARCHITECTURE.md**: Important sections cut off, missing critical design information
- **游리 "Not Yet" Status in Copilot Instructions**: Multiple features marked as "not yet implemented" indicating incomplete functionality
- **游리 Missing Design Patterns**: Analyze script lacks design pattern detection for code quality assessment

## 游릭 LOW SEVERITY ISSUES

### Performance & Optimization (Nice-to-Have)
- **游릭 Low Redis maxmemory**: Current configuration may cause memory issues under load
- **游릭 RAG CPU/GPU Fallback**: AI system lacks graceful degradation when GPU unavailable
- **游릭 No Alerting System**: Missing automated alerts for system issues and performance degradation

### Other Concerns (Future Considerations)
- **游릭 File Growth**: Project expanding rapidly (398 files) without corresponding organization improvements
- **游릭 No Auto-Reprioritization**: Task management lacks intelligent priority adjustment based on project state

## 游늵 Issue Distribution

- **High Severity**: 11 issues (Security: 4, Code Quality: 5, Testing: 2)
- **Medium Severity**: 9 issues (Config: 5, Documentation: 4)
- **Low Severity**: 4 issues (Performance: 3, Other: 1)

## 游꿢 Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Blockers (Week 1-2)
1. **Security Hardening**: Replace all .env placeholders with secure secrets
2. **Test Suite Repair**: Fix import issues and get tests passing (target: 30/34)
3. **Stub Implementation**: Complete core task implementations (market data sync, RAG queries)

### Phase 2: Quality Improvements (Week 3-4)
4. **Code Cleanup**: Remove empty files and resolve duplications
5. **Configuration Fixes**: Complete .env setup and docker security
6. **Documentation Updates**: Refresh README.md and complete ARCHITECTURE.md

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 5+)
7. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement full automated testing and deployment
8. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize Redis, add alerting, improve RAG fallback
9. **Process Automation**: Add auto-reprioritization and file organization

## 游댌 Root Cause Analysis

The primary blockers stem from the **microservices-to-monolith migration artifacts** that were left incomplete. The solid architecture foundation exists, but critical implementation gaps prevent the system from achieving its full potential as an AI-powered trading intelligence platform.

## 游늳 Success Metrics

- **Security**: All .env placeholders replaced, ports secured
- **Testing**: 30+ passing tests, CI pipeline operational
- **Completeness**: No stub implementations, all core features functional
- **Quality**: <5 empty files, no code duplications
- **Documentation**: All docs current and complete

## 游꿟 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Address security issues (env secrets, exposed ports)
2. **Short-term**: Fix test failures and complete stub implementations
3. **Medium-term**: Clean up code quality issues and improve documentation
4. **Long-term**: Optimize performance and add advanced automation

This prioritized issue list should be converted to GitHub Issues with appropriate labels (游댮 critical, 游리 high, 游릭 medium) and assigned to the Kanban board for systematic resolution.
