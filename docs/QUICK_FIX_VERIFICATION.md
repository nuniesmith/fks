# Quick Verification Guide

## What Was Fixed
Fixed the `ValueError: Length of values (1000) does not match length of index (1001)` error that was causing all Optuna optimization trials to fail.

## Changes Made
- `src/trading/utils/backtest_engine.py` - 3 critical fixes for array length alignment
- Added comprehensive test suites to prevent regression

## Verify the Fix

Run this command to test:
```bash
docker exec fks_app python /app/tests/test_backtest_fix_standalone.py
```

Expected: All tests pass âœ“

## What To Expect Now

Your Optuna optimization should work correctly:
- No more `ValueError` exceptions
- Trials will complete successfully  
- Sharpe ratios will be calculated (not -999.0)
- Best parameters will be properly selected

## If You See Issues

1. Restart the fks_app container to ensure changes are loaded
2. Check the logs for any import errors
3. Run the test suite to verify the fix is active

The fix is tested and working - all 5 failing parameter combinations from your error log now pass successfully!
