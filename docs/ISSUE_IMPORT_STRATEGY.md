## Issue Overlap Analysis

### No Conflicts

Your RAG issues are **highly specific** to RAG system implementation, while the platform issues cover **foundational infrastructure**. They complement each other.

### Potential Synergies

- **RAG System Completion** (Platform Phase 2) + **RAG Foundation** (existing #62-73)
- **Trading Signal Integration** (existing #66) + **Celery Tasks** (Platform Phase 2)
- **Production Deployment** (existing #71) + **Production Readiness** (Platform Phase 5)

## Recommended Strategy

### Option A: Import All (Comprehensive Roadmap)

```bash
./scripts/import_github_issues.sh
```

**Result**: 32 total open issues (13 existing + 19 new)

**Pros:**

- Complete visibility into all work
- Proper dependency tracking
- Clear separation (RAG vs Platform labels)

**Cons:**

- Large number of open issues
- Need good organization system

### Option B: Phased Import (Recommended)

```bash
./scripts/organize_issues.sh
```

This interactive script will:

1. Show you current issue analysis
2. Import **only Phase 1 platform issues** (3 critical issues)
3. Optionally create GitHub Project board
4. Allow importing more phases later

**Result**: 16 total open issues (13 existing + 3 Phase 1)

**Pros:**

- Manageable issue count
- Focus on immediate needs
- Can expand later

**Cons:**

- Missing long-term roadmap visibility initially

### Option C: Manual Organization First

1. Review existing RAG issues (#62-73)
2. Add proper milestones and labels
3. Close any that are duplicates or premature
4. Then run import script for platform issues

## Quick Start

### For Immediate Action (Recommended)

```bash
# Interactive helper - analyzes and imports Phase 1 only
./scripts/organize_issues.sh
```

### For Full Import

```bash
# Imports all 19 platform issues
./scripts/import_github_issues.sh
```

### For Manual Review

```bash
# View current issues
gh issue list --limit 20

# View RAG issues specifically  
gh issue list --label "rag"

# View issue details
gh issue view 62  # RAG Foundation
gh issue view 63  # Document Processing
# etc.
```

## Project Board Organization (Recommended)

Create a project board with these columns:

1. **Backlog** - All issues not yet started
2. **RAG Development** - Active RAG work (#62-73)
3. **Platform Development** - Active platform work (new issues)
4. **Testing & QA** - Test-related tasks
5. **In Review** - PRs and code review
6. **Done** - Completed work

```bash
# Create project
gh project create --owner @me --title "FKS Development Roadmap"

# Add issues to project
gh issue list --limit 50 | while read number rest; do
  gh issue edit $number --add-project "FKS Development Roadmap"
done
```

## Labels to Add (For Better Organization)

Current labels are good, but consider adding:

- `priority:critical` - Must do immediately
- `priority:high` - Should do soon
- `priority:medium` - Normal priority
- `priority:low` - Nice to have
- `blocked` - Waiting on something
- `platform` - Platform infrastructure work
- `good-first-issue` - Easy starting points

```bash
# Add priority labels
gh label create "priority:critical" --color "d73a4a"
gh label create "priority:high" --color "ff9800"
gh label create "priority:medium" --color "ffeb3b"
gh label create "priority:low" --color "4caf50"
gh label create "platform" --color "0366d6"
gh label create "blocked" --color "b60205"
```

## Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Action |
|----------|-------------------|
| Want complete roadmap visibility | Option A: Import all 19 issues |
| Feeling overwhelmed by issue count | Option B: Import Phase 1 only (3 issues) |
| Want to organize existing issues first | Option C: Manual review, then import |
| Need project management structure | Create GitHub Project board |
| Starting work immediately | Import Phase 1, start with Security Hardening |

## Next Steps

1. **Run organization script**: `./scripts/organize_issues.sh`
2. **Review results**: `gh issue list`
3. **Create project board** (optional but recommended)
4. **Start with Phase 1 platform work** while continuing RAG development
5. **Import additional phases** as you complete Phase 1
