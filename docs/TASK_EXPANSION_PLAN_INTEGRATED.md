### Phase Numbering Reconciliation

**Original Plan**: Phases 1-12 (from initial AI strategy integration)
**Expansion Plan**: Tasks in Phases 5-9

**Resolution**: 
- Kept existing Phase 1-12 structure intact
- Added "Phase 5-9 Enhancements" as **retrofit sections** (not new phases)
- Phase 8-9 marked as **(Proposed)** - can be renumbered if needed
- Phase 10-12 remain unchanged (Deployment, Iteration, etc.)

**Result**: No numbering conflicts, all tasks properly namespaced.

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Best Practices

### What Worked Well

1. **Incremental Approach**: Completing Phases 7.1-7.3 before planning next 13 tasks
   - Avoided premature optimization
   - Validated architecture with real implementations
   - Identified gaps (WFO, drift detection) through usage

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each completed phase has detailed docs
   - PHASE_7_1_COMPLETE.md (confusion matrices, Bonferroni)
   - PHASE_7_2_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md (LLM-Judge, 592 lines)
   - PHASE_7_3_GROUND_TRUTH_COMPLETE.md (validation framework, 890 lines)
   - Enabled conflict detection during expansion plan review

3. **Test-Driven Development**: 298/298 tests passing before expansion
   - High confidence in existing codebase stability
   - Clear baselines for new feature performance (e.g., ≥80% coverage)

### What to Avoid

1. **Scope Creep**: Don't add more tasks until current 13 are 50% complete
   - Risk: Technical debt accumulation
   - Mitigation: Track completion with GitHub Projects

2. **Parallel Implementation**: Don't start >2 tasks simultaneously
   - Risk: Half-finished features, integration hell
   - Mitigation: Follow sprint sequence strictly

3. **Over-Optimization**: Don't implement Task 6.3.1 (quantization) before 6.1.1 (memory)
   - Risk: Optimizing wrong bottleneck
   - Mitigation: Profile first, optimize second

### Recommended Workflow

For each new task:
1. **Read copilot instructions**: Full task description + acceptance criteria
2. **Create branch**: `git checkout -b feature/task-X.Y.Z`
3. **Write tests first**: Unit + integration (≥80% coverage target)
4. **Implement**: Follow code examples in copilot instructions
5. **Validate**: Run tests, check metrics (e.g., drift <0.2, Sharpe improvement)
6. **Document**: Create TASK_X_Y_Z_COMPLETE.md (mirror Phase docs)
7. **Commit**: Detailed commit message (see Phase 7.3 example)
8. **Update tracking**: Mark task complete in GitHub Projects
