// rithmic-connector — library root.
//
// Foundation / skeleton of the credential-gated, READ-ONLY Rithmic futures
// market-data connector. Design: docs/architecture/RITHMIC_INTEGRATION_SPIKE.md
// (roadmap P12). This crate is a sidecar: it speaks Rithmic's R|Protocol via
// the community `rithmic-rs` crate, subscribes read-only plants, and (later)
// writes to `candles_futures`.
//
// DOCTRINE: read-only by construction. The ORDER plant is never opened; there
// is no order-entry code path anywhere in this crate.
