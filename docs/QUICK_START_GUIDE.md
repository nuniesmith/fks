## üéØ The Three-Question Rule

**Before starting ANY task, ask**:

1. Does this unblock revenue/user value?
2. Does this reduce risk?
3. Is this blocking other tasks?

If NO to all three ‚Üí **Backlog it.**

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Do I have to do all 120 hours?**  
A: No! Phase 1 (19 hrs) makes project stable. Phase 2 (56 hrs) adds core features. Rest is optional enhancements.

**Q: Can I skip Phase 1?**  
A: No. Security + import fixes are blockers for everything else.

**Q: Can I work on multiple phases at once?**  
A: Not recommended. Each phase builds on previous ones. Dependencies exist.

**Q: What if I don't have 10 hours/week?**  
A: Adjust timeline. Even 5 hours/week works - just takes longer. Update dashboard with your pace.

**Q: Can I get help?**  
A: Yes! GitHub Copilot and this documentation are designed to guide you. If stuck >2 hours, document blocker and move to next task.
