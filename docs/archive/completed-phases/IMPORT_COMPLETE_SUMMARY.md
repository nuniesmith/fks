```

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Focus on Phase 1 first** (#74-76)
   - These are foundational and critical
   - Estimated 19 hours total
   - Completes: Security, testing, code quality

2. **Continue RAG work in parallel** (#62-73)
   - Keep RAG and platform work on separate branches
   - Merge platform fixes first
   - Then update RAG work with fixed imports/tests

3. **Move to Phase 2 after Phase 1** (#77-80)
   - Builds on Phase 1 foundation
   - Implements core functionality
   - Estimated 55 hours

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Managing 32 Open Issues

With 32 open issues, organization is key:

1. **Use milestones** to filter by phase
2. **Use labels** to filter by priority/type
3. **Close issues** as you complete them
4. **Consider GitHub Projects** for visual tracking

### Create a Project Board (Optional)

```bash
gh project create --owner @me --title "FKS Development Roadmap"
```

Suggested columns:
- **Backlog** - Not started
- **Phase 1 (Current)** - Active immediate work
- **RAG Development** - Parallel RAG work
- **In Review** - PRs pending
- **Done** - Completed issues

### Staying Focused

With so many issues:
- ✅ **DO**: Focus on one phase at a time
- ✅ **DO**: Complete Phase 1 before Phase 2
- ✅ **DO**: Close issues when done
- ❌ **DON'T**: Jump between phases randomly
- ❌ **DON'T**: Leave issues partially complete

## 📚 Documentation

All documentation is ready:
- **Full guide**: `docs/GITHUB_ISSUES_IMPORT.md`
- **Strategy analysis**: `docs/ISSUE_IMPORT_STRATEGY.md`

- **This summary**: `docs/IMPORT_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md`
- **Quick ref**: `QUICKREF_GITHUB_ISSUES.md`

## ✨ What's Different from Original Script

The original script used `impact:high/medium/low` labels, but we adapted to use your existing labels:
- 🔴 **critical** - Blocks development or deployment
- 🟡 **high** - Important, but not blocking
- 🟢 **medium** - Normal priority
- ⚪ **low** - Nice to have

We also added relevant labels like:
- 🧪 **tests** - Testing related
- 🔒 **security** - Security issues
- 📚 **documentation** - Documentation
- ✨ **feature** - New features
- 🧹 **tech-debt** - Technical debt
- **platform** - Platform work (all 19 issues)

## 🎊 Success!
