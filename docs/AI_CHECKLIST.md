## üìÅ Files to Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/AI_ARCHITECTURE.md` | Complete implementation guide (1040 lines) |
| `docs/AI_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` | This summary with all details |
| `docs/CREATE_AI_ISSUES.md` | Quick start with gh CLI commands |
| `docs/AI_ISSUES_SUMMARY.md` | Issue descriptions and timeline |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Project context for AI agent |

## üéØ Key Decisions Made

### Model Selection

- **Base Layer**: BGE-M3 (567M) - #1 on MTEB, perfect for embeddings
- **Middle Layer**: Qwen3:30b (30B MoE) - 90.6% on MGSM math
- **Middle Layer**: Mathstral (7B) - Specialized for quantitative calculations
- **Top Layer**: Llama4:scout (109B MoE, 17B active) - Strong agentic capabilities

### Architecture Pattern

**3-Layer Approach**:

1. **Base**: Fast embeddings for RAG (2GB VRAM, <100ms)
2. **Middle**: Math reasoning for calculations (16GB VRAM, <2s)
3. **Top**: Agentic orchestration for decisions (24GB VRAM, <3s)

**Why Layered?**

- Optimize for efficiency (small ‚Üí large models)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to test and debug
- Can swap models per layer independently

### Implementation Strategy

**Phased Rollout**:

- Week 1-2: Get embeddings working (low risk)
- Week 3-4: Add reasoning (medium complexity)
- Week 5-6: Enable agentic decisions (high complexity)
- Week 7: Integration and optimization (production-ready)

**Testing Approach**:

- Unit tests for each layer independently
- Integration tests for layer connections
- End-to-end tests with real market data
- Performance benchmarks at each stage

## üí∞ Cost-Benefit Analysis

### OpenAI Approach (Current)

- **Cost**: $0.0001 per 1K tokens
- **Monthly** (1M requests): ~$100
- **Annual**: $1,200 - $50,000 (depending on volume)
- **Risks**: API limits, data privacy, vendor lock-in

### Ollama Approach (Proposed)

- **Cost**: $0 (local inference)
- **One-time**: GPU investment (you already have RTX 4090)
- **Annual**: $0
- **Benefits**: Privacy, unlimited usage, no vendor lock-in

**Break-even**: Immediate (you already have GPU)  
**Annual Savings**: $10,000 - $50,000

## üöÄ Success Metrics

### Technical (Measured in [AI-4])

- [ ] Embedding latency < 100ms
- [ ] Reasoning latency < 2s
- [ ] End-to-end latency < 5s
- [ ] VRAM usage < 24GB (all models loaded)
- [ ] Throughput > 20 decisions/min

### Business (Measured over time)

- [ ] Decision accuracy > 60%
- [ ] Sharpe ratio > 1.5
- [ ] Max drawdown < 20%
- [ ] Win rate > 50%
- [ ] Average R:R > 1:2

### Quality (Measured in code review)

- [ ] All tests passing (unit + integration)
- [ ] Code coverage > 80%
- [ ] Linting errors = 0
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: GitHub CLI auth fails

**Solution**: Make sure you press Enter when prompted, use code E10D-4411, authorize in browser

### Issue: Python script has syntax errors

**Solution**: Use manual gh CLI commands from `docs/CREATE_AI_ISSUES.md` instead

### Issue: Can't access GitHub Projects

**Solution**: Run `gh auth refresh -s read:project,project` to add permissions

### Issue: Ollama models don't fit in VRAM

**Solution**: Use quantization (automatic in Ollama) or load/unload models on demand

### Issue: AI recommendations are inaccurate

**Solution**: Fine-tune models on historical trades, add confidence thresholds, require human approval for large trades

## üìû Next Steps

### Right Now

1. Press Enter in WSL terminal to authorize GitHub CLI
2. Copy commands from `docs/CREATE_AI_ISSUES.md`
3. Create 4 new issues ([AI-1] through [AI-4])
4. Update issue #9 with expanded content

### This Week

5. Focus on Phase 1 (#5, #6, #7)
6. Get test suite passing
7. Remove security vulnerabilities

### Next 7 Weeks

8. Implement AI architecture layer by layer
9. Test thoroughly at each stage
10. Monitor performance and optimize
