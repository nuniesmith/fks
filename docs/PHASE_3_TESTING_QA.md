# ðŸ§ª FKS Phase 3: Testing & QA (Weeks 3-6, Parallel)

**Duration**: 2-4 weeks (parallel with Phase 2) | **Priority**: High Impact/Urgency | **Effort**: Medium
**Focus**: Achieve 80% test coverage, CI/CD integration
**Goal**: Robust, validated codebase ready for production

---

## ðŸ“‹ Sprint Overview

### Phase Objectives

- âœ… **Test Coverage**: Expand to 80% with comprehensive unit/integration tests
- âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline**: Full automation for builds, tests, and deployments
- âœ… **Quality Gates**: Automated linting, security scanning, performance benchmarks
- âœ… **Validation**: Run analyze script after each feature to detect new test needs

### Success Criteria

- [ ] 80%+ test coverage across all modules
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline running on every push/PR
- [ ] All critical paths have integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Analyze script integrated into CI feedback loop

### Kanban Integration

- **Backlog**: Test gaps identified by analyze script
- **To-Do**: New tests needed after feature implementations
- **In-Progress**: Max 3 test tasks (focus on high-coverage items)
- **Done**: Move when coverage targets met and CI passing

- [ ] Mock pgvector for embedding storage/retrieval
- [ ] Test document processing and chunking
- [ ] Validate semantic search accuracy
- [ ] Test Ollama integration with mock responses
- [ ] Cover error handling and fallback scenarios

### 3.1.2 Celery Integration Tests (4 hours)

- [ ] Mock Redis for task queue testing
- [ ] Test task scheduling and execution
- [ ] Validate error handling and retries
- [ ] Test task dependencies and chaining
- [ ] Performance test under load

### 3.1.3 Performance Benchmarks (2 hours)

- [ ] Use pytest-benchmark for backtesting speed
- [ ] Benchmark RAG query response times
- [ ] Test Celery task execution performance
- [ ] Establish baseline metrics for regression detection
- [ ] Set up automated performance monitoring

## ðŸŸ¢ 3.2 CI/CD Setup (Medium Impact/Urgency, Low Effort)

**Duration**: 1 week | **Dependencies**: Phase 1.2 (basic tests working)
**Priority**: Automated quality assurance for ongoing development

### 3.2.1 GitHub Action for Docker Build/Tests/Lint (2 hours)

- [ ] Create comprehensive CI workflow
- [ ] Include Docker build and service tests
- [ ] Add pytest with coverage reporting
- [ ] Integrate black, isort, flake8 linting
- [ ] Configure failure notifications

### 3.2.2 Integrate Analyze Script into CI (1 hour)

- [ ] Add analyze script execution to CI pipeline
- [ ] Auto-commit summary.txt updates
- [ ] Generate coverage and quality reports
- [ ] Set up artifact storage for reports
- [ ] Configure PR comments with analysis results

---

## ðŸ“Š Sprint Tracking

### Coverage Milestones

- [ ] **Week 3**: 50% coverage baseline established
- [ ] **Week 4**: 65% coverage with core modules tested
- [ ] **Week 5**: 75% coverage with integration tests
- [ ] **Week 6**: 80%+ coverage with performance benchmarks

### CI/CD Validation

- [ ] All pushes trigger CI pipeline
- [ ] PRs blocked if tests fail or coverage drops
- [ ] Analyze script runs automatically
- [ ] Quality reports generated and accessible

### Quality Gates

- [ ] **Unit Tests**: All public functions tested
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows validated
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks prevent regressions
- [ ] **Security Tests**: Automated vulnerability scanning
