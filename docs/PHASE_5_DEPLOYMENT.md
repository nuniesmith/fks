# ðŸš€ FKS Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring (Weeks 9-14)

**Duration**: 4-6 weeks | **Priority**: Medium Impact/Urgency | **Effort**: High
**Focus**: Production readiness and monitoring setup
**Goal**: Deployable, monitored trading platform

---

## ðŸ“‹ Sprint Overview

### Phase Objectives

- âœ… **Local/Dev Enhancements**: Fix start.sh, optimize Docker
