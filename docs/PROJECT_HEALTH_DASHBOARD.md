## 🎯 Current Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

**Priority 1: Begin AI Enhancement Phase 1** (1-2 days)
- Task: Data Preparation for ASMBTR Baseline
- Actions:
  - Verify fks_data service operational
  - Fetch EUR/USD tick data via CCXT
  - Implement Δ scanner for micro-price changes (<0.01%)
  - Verify TimescaleDB hypertable compatibility
- Location: `services/data/src/collectors/forex_collector.py`
- Acceptance: EUR/USD tick data streaming, >99% data quality

**Priority 2: Fix Disabled Services** (3-5 hours)
- fks_execution (Rust libc issue) - Consider Ubuntu base image
- fks_web_ui (Architecture review) - Decide Django monolith vs. Vite frontend

**Priority 3: Documentation Maintenance** ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Archived 95 completed/obsolete docs to `docs/archive/`
- ✅ Created consolidated `PHASE_STATUS.md`
- ✅ Updated copilot instructions with 12-phase AI plan
